# Contact-Form
Project: Contact Form
A front end web development project.In this project I created a contact form in fully responsive layout using html, css and javascript, where users can fill their name, email, subject and message and submit it.
I focused on a clean user interface and sufficent validation techniques, and I focused on ensuring accuracy in form submissions. Moreover, this contact form can be added to any webpage and will still function as required.

Key Features:
Responsive and easy to use interface.
Contact form validation to ensure all required fields have been filled (name, email, message).
Contact form styling using css.
PHP, Node js, Firebase and any other backend technology can easily be integrated.

Tech Stack:
